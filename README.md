Welcome to the python exercises repository. Here you will find different types of small and large, easy and hard python exercises that you can use to enhance your coding skills. A breif description about each exercise here is given below:

### Rock Paper Scissor- 
Everyone knows about the famous rock-paper-scissors game ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è. Two players play to determine who is the goat in this game. For this problem, you have to write the code to create this game where the player will play with the computer 10 times. At the end of the game, you have to show who won the game along with the score. Also show if there is a graw between the players. You can find my code to this problem [here](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Python-Learning/blob/Python-Exercises/rockpaperscissor.py)üëà.

### Fizz Buzz-
In this problem, you have to check the divisibility of a number by 3 or 5 or by both 3 and 5. If the number is divisible by 3, print 'FIZZ', similarly for divisiblity by 5, print'BUZZ'. IF ther number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FIZZBUZZ'. Find my code [here](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Python-Learning/blob/Python-Exercises/fizz_or_buzz.py)üëà.

### Guess the Number-
For this problem, a player has to guess the number between 1 and 25, where he will get only 5 chances to win the prize. each turn, if the player guessed the wrong number, the program should tell them if the real number is higher or lower than the guessed number. If after the 5 chances, player is not able to guess the correct number, the player loses. FInd my code for the problem [here](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Python-Learning/blob/Python-Exercises/guessnum.py)üëà.
