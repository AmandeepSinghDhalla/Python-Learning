# Welcome to the Python Learning üêç-
In this repository, I will be sharing various resources like courses, study materials, notes and exercises which I have used to learn python. You will also find different kinds of small and large python projects and problems that I have made or solved during my professional and learning journey.

The IDE or tools that I will be using are PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook, so the files will be in the `.ipynb` or `.py` format. Do let me know if you think I should add something else or if anything can be improved upon. I will bw updating this repository on regular basis.
