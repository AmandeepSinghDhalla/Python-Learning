In this repository, I will be highlighting all the python open source and personal projects that I have worked on from scratch. The projects and the basic idea and solution behind them can be found below.

### Healthy Reminder.
* In this projects, I have made a python program with the help of the PyGame module. This program can be very helpful for the for any IT professional as it will remind the person every hour to relax their eyes and take a break from the regular screen time while working.
* This program will also prompt in regular intervals to exercise properly for a few minutes when sitting on the office chair for long interval of time.
* It will also remind the professional to stay hydrated and drink water in regular interval of time.
